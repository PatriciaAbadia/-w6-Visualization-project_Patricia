# Visualization Project

## Introduction

In this visualization project I will analyze the profit margins of several publishers taking into account publication titles and authors.
The data were provided in a previous project.

## Data sources

The data was provided directly to proceed with this project.

## Structure

Initially I noticed that the sales prices by number of copies sold do not match the YTD Sales, so I used only this last data in my analysis. 
In the same way, I used the royalties shown in the 'titles' table.
Thus, on the one hand, I have considered the net income of each publisher by applying the corresponding royalties percentage. And on the other hand, I have considered what would remain to be collected by the author as an advance payment. 

In this way, it can be seen that there are titles that have generated losses for the publishers on a daily basis.

And the same for authors, I have identify the net income for each author by applying the corresponding royalties percentage and the related balance derived from the advances received for future sales.
